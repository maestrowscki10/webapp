     <p1> From my childhood I like breaking and building staff. I love both software and hardware. Since my childhood I am curious about how the Information Technology works.</p1> <br>
<p2> From that part I am interested in computer science. I have taken Python courses in coursera.
I am interested in Cyber Security, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. <br> Actually I am a good self learner and also a quick learner. I am looking for help from professional developers. <br> If I get stuck in some point then I hope that I will find some solution from this platform.
